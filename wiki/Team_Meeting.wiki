Dear Friends;
We had two different meetings with different members today, the ones who didn't show up, shame on you.
We will consider the patterns that mentioned in our last slide, named "system architecture". And we decided to use model view controller pattern (at page 17). 
You need to study it. We shared the subjects. Bilal, ibrahim, çağdaş şenol, ali kerim will decide what whould be done and inform us until sunday evening, and everyone will do the job on their part.
