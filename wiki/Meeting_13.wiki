===Subjects:===

 * 2. Problems related to Eclipse.
===Decisions :===
 * There was actually no meeting.
===Problems :===
 * 1. Bilal has informed us about his unavailability, therefore he proposed to have a meeting at Tuesday, but no others have agreed or disagreed this. Therefore we tried to have regular meeting.
 * 2. Eclipse is still problematic, Bilal was the one who is working on it. Therefore if to change the environment is possible, it is useless working on Eclipse.
