== Test Case 1 Using Game Search Module==
First of all let us assume that the user whoose name is "Zeynep" is already signed in to our system. Note that the sign in and sign up processes are described in other test case scenarios. Also let us assume there are already some games created in the database. One of these games is called “South Campus”. Also there is no such game in the database named as “North Campus”. After these assumptions using game search module to find and play a game is as follows:

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th align = "left">Steps</th>
    <th align = "left">Actions</th>
    <th align = "left">Expected Results</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Click "Search Game" button from the main page</td>
    <td>The page for searching games which includes a text field to write the keywords and a search button should appear</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Write keywords North Campus with quotation marks so that it will be searched exactly as it is</td>
    <td>Since there is no game in the database with name "North Campus", you should see no games found with keywords "North Campus"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Write keywords North Campus without quotation marks so that all the games containing north and campus keyword will be searched</td>
    <td>You should see all the games including north and campus words in their names. In our case you should be able to view the game named "South Campus"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>Write keywords South Campus with quotation marks so that it will be searched exactly as it is</td>
    <td>You should see the game named as "South Campus".</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>Click to the game "South Campus"</td>
    <td>You should see its details which are entered by its creater</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>From game details page click "Play" button</td>
    <td>You should see the first clue or QR Code location to start the game</td>
  </tr>
</table>

After the last step Zeynep can play the game as it is described in the play game test scenario.
