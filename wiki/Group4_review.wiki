This document is to point out the reviews about mass observation project which is under the custody of cmpe352 student group #4.


In the functional requirements part:

4.1.2.4 The initiator should be able to set a unique ID for every observer.
	(In such a system it would be better to do such a numerization automatically.The email addresses are also globally 	

unique)

4.1.3.3 Observers should give their telephone numbers and accept the terms of use to be able to make an observation.  
	(It may be dangerous to prompt users for giving their telephone numbers to the system since it is not needed.Users 	

	are using mobile applications through internet connections so sharing telephone number is redundance)


In class diagram:

There is no specific data or abstraction about 'consumer' type users.It would be better to have a class (or interface) for 

'consumer'.
