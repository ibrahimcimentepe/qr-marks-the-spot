# QR MARKS THE SPOT #

  * QR Marks the Spot creates a chance for you to build a game which ties up whoever comes contact with, which creeps down from virtual world to the real one.
  * Care for a change? Got bored with those virtual presence games? Sick of playing soccer with your console? Here in QR Marks the Spot we offer you the chance to get down on the ground and actually do!
  * All you need to do is, sign-up, design and create your very first game so that others can play. Or you if you are not the designer type, just pick one and join.
  * Follow the QR marks, solve the riddles, win the prize!

> _**"Let the game begin!"**_
