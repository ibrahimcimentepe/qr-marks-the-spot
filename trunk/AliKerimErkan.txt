1.I think Google Code is the true solution for project collaboration.It is the easy way of discussing,managing and producing a project with a group of people.Since in this course we didnt have a common server for such a digital medium,Google Code basically overcame this necessity.In terms of efficiencies,it has both subversion and mercurial supports for version managing,it allows online code reviewing and commenting which will probably be the most useful features for us in cmpe451.It also helps to follow the state of the project with updates page and e-mail notifications.Finally issue tracking also seems very useful in terms of managing the progress of development even if we didnt use it so much in this course yet.The only point that I didnt like was the mark-up style for the wiki page.I would rather prefer a WYSIWYG system for documents and representation of the project even if it is not the professional way. 

2.At first sight our project seems an enjoyable thing to work on and develop but as time passed week by week in this course I realized that it is neither a well defined nor a white hope system.Maybe I am exaggerating the point but I have read all other groups' project descriptions again and I should say that their requirements are nearly perfectly defined (of course the requirements change in development progress but we are not given even a route map in project description.If you want we can talk about this issue later and I can convince you that I think "treasure hunt" doesnt help to solve anybody's need on the world so it shouldnt continue to be a cmpe451 project.But all in all these are just my ideas..) but our project's description looks like an open circuit.Even if it was fun to discuss on it,the project is very flexible so it is hard to come up with a good decision of how to design it.Additionally we didnt have a 'customer' until the end of the semester which caused us to decide our all requirements on our way of understanding rather than on a specific customer's perpective.

3.No.I would like to work on a more serious project rather than a game.

4.Yes.I think from now on I can participate in wicked software development teams and contribute to the process more professionally.Altough experience is the most powerful virtue,I can produce and evaluate good ideas based on software engineering principles and tools easily than ever.
