Without arranging meetings, one can also comment and develop the work processed through Google Code.  It also helps you to work in an organized manner if you use to tools provided. For example, the "Issues" serve as "drafts" page where you can revise the documents to finalize.  Finally, Google Code was simple and efficient, thus we were able to use it easily.\

2. Since our project was mainly a "game", I enjoyed brainstorming on it.  Also, our game somewhat resembles a "treasure hunt" which we all of us have at least once played.  In this case, the treasures are the QR barcodes.  The fact that the game creators are not restricted in developing their games in certain fields makes our project flexible and open to creativity.  Lastly, our project enables the addition of various simple extra tools according to customer needs/feedback.\

4. In our project, we mostly used an incremental method during the design processes.  We defined to overall functional/nonfunctional requirements first, but improved them according to the feedback we received. We also created a prototype for the system requirements.  After learning these concepts in class, we were able to apply them on our project's phases.  The software engineering approach helped us develop our roadmap.}
