1. Google code is very useful tool to be in part of largescale projects. However, when there is a clear seperation between the jobs done by the team members, 
there is no very useful aspects. For example for our project, we used mostly mailing to give weekly jobs to participants. And no two of us took the same job, 
therefore, "gmail" were enough for our project. On the other hand, if we would work for same jobs over and over, to use the shared files in google code would 
be perfect for us. Also, when the connection between members limited, i mean if we are not able to talk directly to members, assigning jobs and discussing them 
on google code would be quite useful.

2. Our project was not very complex, i believe i understand the concept and was able to improve the contents. However, the games and other specific details are 
needed to be found from public participation. We were not quite enable to give many different and interesting kind of games.  Therefore, we couldn't see the extents 
of the project in such a limited time. Also, we were too new to understand the importance of the well organized team participation, therefore most of the time we 
couldn't seperate the jobs equally. Most of the time it was a burden to be able to be well prapared for the class. These handicaps made the project for us very ineffective. 
Other than that, i believe our project is quite entertaining and worth to shot.

3. Our project were quite hard for me, however it is the most improvable project in all projects. I would prefer to work on this project in effective way.

4. Of course, the basic types of designs, what is needed to satisfy customer and supponsors, what is team work and what are the necessary skills and qualifications
 that should be in team members, also the importance of disciplined work is quite understood. The basic steps for software engineering are known and ready 
to use for another project.
