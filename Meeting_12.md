### Subjects: ###
  * 1. First Milestone deliverables.
  * 2. Review of our project plan.
  * 3. Database Problem and its solution.

### Decisions : ###
  * We now have Sign in / Sign out / Registration Module and working databses on several computers. To create Newsfeed module is not necessary in this first level. It has been put to later milestones.
  * We established a new "Responsibility Matrix". According to this matrix, Ali Kerim and Akif Cem are accountable for all deliverables if they are not responsible.
  * On the other hand we still have a problem on connecting to School's server. Since this problem is not vital, it has been put in later levels.
