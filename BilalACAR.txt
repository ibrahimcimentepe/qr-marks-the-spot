1. Google code is a cool tool to develop software. But I think Source Forge is better. At least it is more
attractive. I find Google code hard to understand and use.

2. Our project is the most interesting project among the projects done by our class this semester. Helping people
to play games and to solve puzzles in real world from a Internet is an interesting idea.

3. I would like work at that project.

4. I think at least I have gained some idea about UML and subversioning.
